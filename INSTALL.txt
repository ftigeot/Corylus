Installation instructions
=========================

  Ruby 1.9.x will not work due to beeing unable to process UTF-8 data
  by default

Required Ruby gems:

These may not be packaged on all operating systems

* Ruby on Rails 3.2.0 or more recent _in the 3.2 branch_

* pg

* will_paginate

* puma (web server, can be replaced by something else)



Installation

1. Create a new PostgreSQL database

2. Create the database structure

   The db/create.sh shell script exists for this purpose. It needs to
   be adapted to your local installation.

3. Configure the database parameters in config/database.yml

4. Set up a database backup routine
   This of course has nothing to do with Corylus installation per se but
   is only good practice.

5. Configure the tomcat url in config/settings.yml
   Tomcat is only needed to generate PDF versions of your documents; its
   use is optional but the file needs to exist.

6. Make sure the Corylus installation directory can be accessed by
   your web server user.
   
   Ruby on Rails stores session data in cookies, which requires
   a secret character string to be generated.
   The first time Corylus is run, it will generate a new secret and write
   it in a file named "secret-token.txt" in the root of the Corylus
   directory

7. Test the installation by running the Puma web server
   
   * rc.d/corylus.sh exists for that purpose

   * It needs to be customized a bit
   
   * Setting for example BIND_IP_PORT to [::1]:3000 will make Corylus
     available on http://localhost:3000/

   * If you point a web browser to this URL, you should now see the
     application login page

8. Use the default administrator account to log in:

   login: admin
   password: admin

   You can now configure the application settings.
   It is recommanded you change your administrator password and create a
   non-privileged user.
